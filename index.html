                <p>The war was over. Prince Don Pedro was happy. He came to Messina with his good friends, Claudio and Benedick. They were guests of Leonato, the governor. Everyone was celebrating and felt safe...</p>
                <p>Leonato had a kind daughter named Hero. She was there to welcome them. A young man named Claudio saw her. He liked her right away. She liked him too.</p>
                <p>Beatrice was Hero's cousin. She was very smart and funny. She saw Benedick. Benedick did not want to get married, and Beatrice did not want to get married either. They started a "fun fight" with words. They said funny, clever things to each other.</p>
                <p>Later, Claudio told Don Pedro that he loved Hero. "I want to marry her," he said. The Prince liked love stories. He made a plan. That night, at a party with masks, the Prince would wear a costume. He would talk to Hero for Claudio.</p>
                <p>But not everyone was happy. Don Pedro's brother, Don John, was not happy. He heard the plan. Don John was a bad man. He wanted to make trouble. He told his friend, Borachio, that he wanted to stop the plan.</p>
                <p>At the party, Don John tried to trick Claudio. He told Claudio that the Prince wanted Hero for himself. But it was not true. Soon, Don Pedro brought Hero to Claudio. He said that her father agreed they could get married.</p>
                <p>The wedding was in one week. Don Pedro had a new idea. He wanted to trick Benedick and Beatrice. He wanted them to fall in love. Leonato and Claudio wanted to help with this good trick.</p>
                <p>First, they made a plan for Benedick. Benedick was hiding in the garden. He was pretending to read. Don Pedro, Claudio, and Leonato talked very loudly. They said that Beatrice loved Benedick very much, but she was too scared to tell him.</p>
                <p>Next, it was Beatrice's turn. Hero and her friend, Ursula, walked in the garden. They talked loudly too. They said that poor Benedick was very sad because he loved Beatrice, and she did not love him. Beatrice was hiding nearby. She heard everything.</p>
                <p>So, one love story was starting. But another love story was going to have a big problem. </p>
                <p>Don John took them to a place under Hero's window. It was dark. They saw a man, Borachio, talking to a woman at the window. The woman was really Hero's friend, Margaret. But Borachio called her "Hero." This was part of the bad plan.</p>
                <p>The next day was the wedding. Everything went wrong. The priest asked Claudio if he would marry Hero. Claudio was very angry. "No," he shouted. He told everyone that Hero was bad. He made her feel very ashamed. She was so sad that she fainted.</p>
                <p>It was a very bad situation. The wise priest, Friar Francis, had a plan. He said they should tell everyone that Hero died from sadness. Beatrice was very upset. She knew her cousin was a good person. She was alone with Benedick and said something surprising: "Kill Claudio."</p>
                <p>But soon, people learned the truth. The local policemen were not very smart, but they were heroes. Their leader was a funny man named Dogberry. They heard Borachio talking. He was drunk. He said that Don John gave him money to trick the Prince. The policemen arrested him.</p>
                <p>When everyone knew about the bad plan, Claudio felt very, very bad. Leonato told him what he must do. He must marry Leonato's "niece." This girl looked just like Hero. Claudio wanted to make things right, so he said yes right away.</p>
                <p>At the new wedding, the bride wore a veil over her face. When she took it off, it was Hero! She was alive and everyone knew she was good. Claudio cried because he was so happy. Then, Benedick and Beatrice finally said they loved each other. Their friends showed everyone the love poems they wrote. So, there were two weddings that day.</p>
